i have two devices that are trying to share an ip address. they are trying to share 96.26.27.9619. one is a printer with the hostname of prtjc0074, and the other is a new display for erp. the display is using dhcp to get its address assigned and the printer is hard coded.

my guess is that the address 96.26.27.9619 did not get set to a static address in dhcp. i need this corrected so the display will pick up another address.",en,kxsceyzo naokumlb,4

the printer01 printer is not working and needs a part replaced.  can you reroute the jobs in queue to printer printer02?   wihuyjdo qpogfwkb has indicated that prqos001 needs a new part and it may not deliver for a few days so the inwarehouse_tools will need to print on printer02 for now.  this needs to be taken care of today since the inwarehouse_tools are printed and are picked up by an outside vendor at 2:30 pm in usa on a daily basis.   please contact dkmcfreg anwmfvlgenkataramdntyana if you have questions about the jobs in queue for today.",en,yisohglr uvteflgb,5

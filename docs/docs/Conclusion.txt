\section{Summary}

Because of the Data Modeling its very clear on how the ticketing system model can classify the tickets effectively. there are other benefits of such system which are listed below.

\subsubsection*{Benefits:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Increase in Customer Satisfaction.
    \item Decrease in the response and resolution time.
    \item Eliminate human error in Ticket Assignment. (Which was $\sim$25\% Incidents)
    \item Avoid missing SLAs due to error in Ticket Assignment.
    \item Eliminate any Financial penalty associated with missed SLAs.
    \item Excellent Customer Service.
    \item Reallocate ($\sim$ 1 FTE) requirement for Productive Work. 
    \item Increase in morale of L1 / L2 Team.
    \item Eradicate 15 mins Effort spent for SOP review ($\sim$ 25-30\% of Incidents or 531.25-637.5 Person Hours).
    \item Decrease in associated Expense.
    \item L1 / L2 Team can focus on resolving $\sim$ 54\% of the incidents
    \item Functional / L3 teams can focus on resolving $\sim$ 56\% of incidents
\end{enumerate}

$\sim$1 FTE from L1 / L2 Team saved through automating Ticket Assignment can focus on Continuous Improvement activities.
$\sim$ 25\% of Incidents which is 2125 additional Incidents will now get resolved within SLA.

\subsubsection*{Additional Business Insights:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Root cause analysis (RCA) need to be performed on job\_scheduler, to understand the cause of failure.
    No. of Incident Ticket reduction expected by performing RCA: 1928. 
    22.68\% of Total Incident volume of 8500.
    Hence, we can reduce the Resource / FTE allocation also by approximately 22.68\%.
    \item Password Rest process need to be automated.
    No. of Incident Ticket reduction expected by automating password reset process:- 1246
    14.66\% of Total Incident volume of 8500. 
    Hence, we can reduce the Resource / FTE allocation also by approximately 14.66\%.
    Hence a cumulative reduction of 3174 Incidents means 37.34\% reduction in Total Incident volume of 8500. 
    Hence, cumulative Resource / FTE allocation reduction by approximately 37.34\%.
    Business can operate at $\sim$62.66\% of original Estimates.
\end{enumerate}
